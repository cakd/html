Maybe the best way to answer your questions is to consider each platform individually.<br /><br /><div><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j5TbpeXq_9M/WCHaj7UypMI/AAAAAAAAjg8/MTl2eJCFCYsM0sLhYtHuEX5afFRg_toZwCLcB/s1600/blogger-logo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j5TbpeXq_9M/WCHaj7UypMI/AAAAAAAAjg8/MTl2eJCFCYsM0sLhYtHuEX5afFRg_toZwCLcB/s200/blogger-logo.jpg" width="200" /></a><b><span style="color: #783f04; font-size: large;"><a href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.com/">Blogger</a></span></b></div><div><b><i>Features / Benefits</i></b><br />1. Blog posts are archived and open to search on the Internet, unlike the "walled gardens" or password-protected feeds. The posts will always be available (hopefully)&nbsp;and will continue to attract readers long after you post them.<br />2. Comments on blogs are the most in-depth and thoughtful. There&#39;s a genuine exchange of information among members of the blog reading community.<br />3. The downside is that blogging isn&#39;t growing much. A lot of traffic has gone to Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. But quality is more important than quantity, so I value blogging as a centerpiece platform.<br /><br /><b><i>My strategy</i></b><br />1. I post daily as a discipline to think about something new every day and to be accountable to that thinking by publicly writing about it.<br />2. The post can be short or long, light or serious. No one minds a short post if it&#39;s free. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t use Patreon or a paywall, because I want to give myself permission to do lightweight posts as well as researched or in-depth ones.<br />3. Sometimes I post an image first on Facebook or Instagram to see what sorts of reactions and questions it generates, and then I address those reactions when I write the blog post.<br /><br /><b><i>Suggested Dos and Don&#39;ts</i></b><br />1. If you want to appeal to artists, make the presentation visual and keep the writing concise.<br />2. Give credits to images or quotes whenever you can. Link to other bloggers. It&#39;s a win/win.<br />3. It&#39;s OK to monetize and promote, but balance promo with useful info. Also, be open about how you&#39;re earning an income. In my case, I don&#39;t accept sponsored posts. I sometimes review things that people send me, but only if I truly like them.<br /><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WwwKq4onl6o/WCHaj5Ry_nI/AAAAAAAAjhA/RXv9uJgqXccv7TpVFrhkhnnSGotzU9hrACLcB/s1600/fb_icon_325x325.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WwwKq4onl6o/WCHaj5Ry_nI/AAAAAAAAjhA/RXv9uJgqXccv7TpVFrhkhnnSGotzU9hrACLcB/s200/fb_icon_325x325.png" width="200" /></a></div>&nbsp;<b><span style="color: #783f04; font-size: large;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/JamesMGurney/">Facebook</a></span></b><br /><b><i>Features</i></b><br />1. Facebook gets the most traffic and comments. I&#39;ve had videos get more views in one day on FB that they did in years on YouTube.<br />2. But that traffic dies down in a day and the post gets buried by other stuff and is soon forgotten. There&#39;s no search function and the user is not in control of what they see.<br />3. People are moving fast. Discussion is lively but it tends to be lighter.<br /><br /><b><i>My strategy</i></b><br />1. If I&#39;m adapting a blog post to FB, I try to extract the single most interesting point from the post along with the most exciting visual.<br />2. I read all the comments and I appreciate them. When people ask questions, I try to answer them, or at least give a relevant link. I regret that I don&#39;t have time to really engage on the level of "liking" comments or commenting on other people&#39;s posts very often.<br />3. I try to keep my posts art-related, and I avoid voicing opinions on issues that don&#39;t have any bearing on my art career.<br /><br /><b><i>Dos and Don&#39;ts</i></b><br />1. Be brief. Give everyone just one thing to think about, to share or to crack a joke about.<br />2. If a link to the blog can extend the reader&#39;s experience, add it. But if not, don&#39;t. Here&#39;s why: links leading out of FB can lower the placement that the post gets in the organic feed. In other words, FB&#39;s algorithm seems to optimize posts that keep people inside FB. From a marketing standpoint, I&#39;ve noticed that links on Facebook are weaker on clickthrough.<br /><div>3. You get much more traffic on videos if you upload the video to FB rather than just giving a link to YouTube.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pgtsb3TZ0mc/WCHailWpB3I/AAAAAAAAjgw/lq-97tXNnX0QcIW7Vhtm81skxpvJEpcHwCLcB/s1600/Instagram_App_Large_May2016_200.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pgtsb3TZ0mc/WCHailWpB3I/AAAAAAAAjgw/lq-97tXNnX0QcIW7Vhtm81skxpvJEpcHwCLcB/s1600/Instagram_App_Large_May2016_200.png" /></a></div>&nbsp;<b><span style="color: #783f04; font-size: large;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jamesgurneyart/">Instagram</a></span></b><br /><b><i>Features</i></b><br />1. The user gets to choose whom they follow and thereby control their experience.<br />2. Highly visual, ideal for artists and photographers. The audience is younger than FB or Blogger.<br />3. Video can be up to 1 minute.<br /><br /><b><i>My strategy</i></b><br />1. I post daily to Instagram. It&#39;s a random mix of early work, recent things, sketches, videos, and finished art. When I post an older work I don&#39;t identify it as old. It may be old to me, but most likely it&#39;s new to my followers.<br />2. I don&#39;t do lifestyle photos such as plates of food or pictures of me unless it shows insight into working methods. I only show my own art, not art by other artists who inspire me.<br />3. I keep my list of people that I follow under 100 so that I can see all their posts. I rotate people in and out of my feed to mix it up. Please don&#39;t be offended if I follow and then unfollow you. I&#39;ll probably come back again.<br /><b><i><br /></i></b><b><i>Dos and Don&#39;ts</i></b><br />1. There are image processing filters, but if you use them, dial them back and make them understated.<br />2. Keep the number of hashtags to between four and ten. Try to use hashtags of a size that gets you into the array of "Top Posts." That way you&#39;re more likely to get discovered by new followers.<br />3. With a video, start with a frame that you want to be the thumbnail. You can end the video with that frame too. Instagram seems to favor video that feels raw and unedited, with a minimum amount of graphics, voiceover, edits.<br /><br /><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-f4dqJMkNe1w/WCHakvLQA0I/AAAAAAAAjhE/p12oahYAoxAntLBTPcPOfg0Hmf-HBtdPgCLcB/s1600/youtube-logo-png-20%2Bcopy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="197" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-f4dqJMkNe1w/WCHakvLQA0I/AAAAAAAAjhE/p12oahYAoxAntLBTPcPOfg0Hmf-HBtdPgCLcB/s200/youtube-logo-png-20%2Bcopy.jpg" width="200" /></a><br /><b><span style="color: #783f04; font-size: large;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/jamesgurney">YouTube</a></span></b><b><i><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" />Features / Benefits</i></b><br />1. Videos are the best way to reach a big audience to present your working process, to tell your story, or to express your personality.<br />2. Videos can be embedded in blog posts; however, embedded vids don&#39;t appear in posts sent out through email subscriptions.<br />3. YouTube advances your video in at least three ways: as a general recommendation, in response to a user&#39;s search, and as a subscription. The algorithm favors "watch time" and frequency of release. The number of views may not be as important in the algorithm as is the watchthrough and other factors. YouTube is a community, so interacting with the comments is important.<br /><br /><b><i>My strategy</i></b><br />1. &nbsp;Videos can be long or short, but the ideal length seems to be around 3 - 4 minutes.<br />2. Video trailers should always have useful content rather than being all sales pitch. You can link in the description or via <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6140493?hl=en">"cards,"</a> which let you link to a site that you own and control.<br />3. Unless the music is central to the presentation, I avoid running it under everything, and prefer to use it at the beginning and end. I use natural audio FX under time lapse, which keeps it from feeling like disconnected reality.<br /><b><i><br /></i></b><b><i>Dos and Don&#39;ts</i></b><br />1. Always start with your best stuff in the first few seconds. Talk and titles can wait. YouTube gives you <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1714323?hl=en">analytics </a>that let you track engagement over time.<br />2. If you&#39;re talking on camera, use a lav mike. Good audio is the most important element of professionalism.<br />3. Keep transitions simple (cut, fade, and dissolve).

Designed for people who love images.<br />2. Like Blogger, it&#39;s open to search.<br />3. Conveniently arranges images by topic.<br /><br /><b><i>My strategy</i></b><br />1. I divide my boards by media and add new images when they come along.<br />2. Pinterest is a great way to gauge relative popularity of images. If I have a board with 20 pins of gouache sketches, I can see by the number of likes and shares which ones people like best.<br />3. Use a title with words that help identify the image to search engines.<br /><b><i><br /></i></b><b><i>Dos and Don&#39;ts</i></b><br />1. Make the images big enough (say about 800 pixels or so) to be able to be worth clicking on.<br />2. Don&#39;t watermark images.<br />3. Be sure to give the essential information of title, medium and size.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-prHchaXM3Ns/WCHai7hML-I/AAAAAAAAjg0/46eprVz6AfMfpiMWFlpe7RhYJ9AREtrDwCLcB/s1600/Twitter-Logo.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-prHchaXM3Ns/WCHai7hML-I/AAAAAAAAjg0/46eprVz6AfMfpiMWFlpe7RhYJ9AREtrDwCLcB/s200/Twitter-Logo.png" width="198" /></a></div><b><i><span style="color: #783f04; font-size: large;"><a href="https://twitter.com/GurneyJourney">Twitter</a></span></i></b><br /><b><i>Features / Benefits</i></b><br />1. The enforced brevity brings out one&#39;s best.<br />2. Videos are limited to 45 seconds. They let you crop a segment of that length out of the whole video.<br />3. Hashtags let people who like your subject find you.<br /><br /><b><i>My strategy</i></b><br />1. As with FB, I post the main image of the day and a link to a blog post with more information.<br />2. I try to remember that Twitter is microblogging, so anything that works on a blog works in miniature on Twitter.<br />3. The power of Twitter is the hashtag and the retweet. People like to retweet things that make them look good to their friends.<br /><br /><b><i>Dos and Don&#39;ts</i></b><br />1. Don&#39;t just use an automated system to propagate a post on multi-platforms. Instead take the time to customize each one.<br />2. Start with the strongest word if possible. People are moving fast.<br />3. Don&#39;t fill the 140 word limit unless you need to.<br />----<br />Am I missing something? Anything you&#39;ve learned that I overlooked?
