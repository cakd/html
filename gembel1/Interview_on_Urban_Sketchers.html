         <a href="http://citizensketcher.wordpress.com/">Mark Taro Holmes </a>just released the following <a href="http://www.urbansketchers.org/2013/12/interview-with-james-gurney.html">interview on the group blog Urban Sketchers</a>.<br /><br /><div><div class="post-body entry-content" style="line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0px 0px 0.75em;"><img alt="Tiny_Landscapes_Photo" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3190" data-mce-src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/tiny_landscapes_photo.jpg" data-mce-style="border: 1px solid black;" height="300" src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/tiny_landscapes_photo.jpg" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px;" width="400" /><br /><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #3366ff;" style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>MTH:</strong></span><span data-mce-style="color: #3366ff;" style="color: #3366ff;">&nbsp;I asked around if any of our sketchers had a question for you. Here’s one that’s a great opener from Cathy Johnson of Missouri:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #3366ff; line-height: 1.6em;">"I&#39;ve loved James Gurney since his very first book, back in the 80s; The Artist&#39;s Guide to Sketching, with Thomas Kinkade (yes, that Kinkade--they took different paths!)&nbsp; Two young men taking off to sketch across America...it&#39;s delightful! "</span><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #000000;" style="color: black;"><strong>J.G:&nbsp;</strong></span>Thanks, Cathy! I love your work too, ever since I first saw it in An Illustrated Life.<br /><br />Tom Kinkade and I were assigned together as freshmen roommates at UC Berkeley when we were both 17 years old. Over the years we went on a lot of sketching adventures together.&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.com/2011/09/part-3-fire-ice-tom-kinkade.html" href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.com/2011/09/part-3-fire-ice-tom-kinkade.html" style="color: #999999; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">I knew him long before</a>&nbsp;he became the “Painter of Light.”<br /><br />We both went to the same art school, but we left after a couple semesters because we started getting jobs, and the school wasn’t teaching what we wanted to learn. Plus, after reading the on-the-road adventures by Jack Kerouac, Charles Kuralt, and John Steinbeck, we wanted to leave behind the cramped, windowless classrooms and confront the real world with our sketchbooks.<br /><br />We filled our backpacks full of art supplies and hopped on a freight train heading east out of&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Los Angeles. We were too broke for hotels, so we slept in graveyards and underpasses and we sketched gravestone cutters, lumberjacks, and ex-cons. To make enough money for food, we drew two-dollar portraits in bars by the light of cigarette machines.</span><br /><br /><a data-mce-href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.ca/2011/09/part-3-fire-ice-tom-kinkade.html" href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.ca/2011/09/part-3-fire-ice-tom-kinkade.html" style="color: #999999; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"><img alt="Gurney_Kinkade_Missouri" class="alignnone  wp-image-3192" data-mce-src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/gurney_kinkade_missouri.jpg" data-mce-style="border: 1px solid black;" height="400" src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/gurney_kinkade_missouri.jpg" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px;" width="315" /></a><br /><br />Here’s a picture of Tom and me wearing matching gas station uniform shirts with our sketchbooks in rural Missouri.<br /><br />We made it all the way to Manhattan. We sketched the city by day, and by night we slept on abandoned piers and rooftops. We had a crazy idea to write a how-to book on sketching, so we made the rounds of the publishers. There weren’t many books in print on the subject, other than the 1976 book “On the Spot Drawing” by Nick Meglin. But our heroes were older: Menzel, Guptill, Watson, and Kautzky.<br /><br />We hammered out the basic plan for the book on paper placemats in a Burger King on the Upper West Side. We were never completely comfortable with the word “sketching,” because it implied something that is cursory or casual or tentative. We wanted to do art from observation that was accurate and detailed, but more importantly, vital, probing and totally committed.<br /><br /><a data-mce-href="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/artists-guide-book-cover.jpg" href="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/artists-guide-book-cover.jpg" style="color: #999999; text-decoration: none;"><img alt="Artists Guide Book Cover" class="alignnone  wp-image-3193" data-mce-src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/artists-guide-book-cover.jpg?w=600" data-mce-style="border: 1px solid black;" height="320" src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/artists-guide-book-cover.jpg?w=600" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px;" width="261" /></a><br /><br />We eventually got a contract from Watson-Guptill, and the book was published in 1982. It is as much about the adventure of sketching on the road as it is about technique. It’s out of print now, very expensive to buy. Before Tom died we talked about bringing it back to print again, but we just got too busy with other projects.<br /><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #3366ff;" style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>MTH:</strong>&nbsp;What effect did that adventure have on your location work?</span><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #000000;" style="color: black;"><strong>J.G:</strong>&nbsp;One effect of that trip on both of us was that we developed a healthy respect for how different people look at artwork. We set up a little stand at the Missouri state raccoon-hunting championships with the goal of doing portraits of everybody’s favorite dogs. The owners were very particular about the dogs’ proportions and markings, and they weren’t going to pay us the two dollars we were asking unless we got the details right. It was a tougher critique than we ever got in art school.</span><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #3366ff;" style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>MTH:</strong>&nbsp;As a follow up to that, you are well known for your works of fantastic art, and your vivid realizations of ancient history (I’m thinking of the National Geographic work).&nbsp; These seem like ideal subjects for a illustrator– depicting things that no longer (or never did) exist – but making them as real as possible. As an Urban Sketcher, naturally I wonder how much of this you credit to your background sketching? What’s the relationship between observing the world and visualizing your imagination?</span><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #000000;" style="color: black;"><strong>J.G:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, the inner eye and outer eye. The two are inseparable. A few times I got to travel on research assignments for National Geographic with the art director J. Robert Teringo, who was also a fanatic for sketching and a graduate of the Famous Artist’s School.</span><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #000000;" style="color: black;">We brought our watercolors to Israel and Jordan and Petra while researching an archaeology story about Palestine during the time of the Caesars. I brought a camera, too, but the location studies were more useful. It wasn’t hard to imagine the clock turning back to a time before photography was invented, when artists were necessary members of archaeological expeditions.&nbsp;</span><br /><a data-mce-href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.ca/2009/01/denon-in-egypt.html" href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.ca/2009/01/denon-in-egypt.html" style="color: #999999; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"><img alt="DominiqueVivantDenon" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3205" data-mce-src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/dominiquevivantdenon1.jpg?w=600" data-mce-style="border: 1px solid black;" height="248" src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/dominiquevivantdenon1.jpg?w=600" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px;" width="400" /></a><br /><br />You mention fantasy work. I’m probably best known for writing and illustrating Dinotopia, the book about a world where humans and dinosaurs coexist. Dinotopia’s whole premise is that of a 19th century explorer named Arthur Denison documenting a new world with his sketchbook. The idea for Dinotopia came directly from my on-the-road sketching days with Kinkade and my field research sketching for National Geographic.<br /><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #3366ff;" style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>MTH:</strong>&nbsp;Would you say that all of your major works have some element of field study? Which happens more often - an idea for an imaginative work that requires you to make field studies, or a sketch on location that inspires a studio painting?</span><strong><br /></strong><br />It goes both ways. Sketching from life definitely builds my visual vocabulary, which helps when I’m trying to conjure a fantasy world from thin air. I often dig into my sketchbooks for poses, rock formations, trees, landscape effects, or other details. That’s one of the reasons I like to draw everything. As Adolph Menzel put it: “alles Zeichnen ist nützlich, und alles zeichnen auch" (“All drawing is useful, and to draw everything as well.”)<br /><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #3366ff;" style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>MTH:</strong>&nbsp;You seem to enjoy using sketching to get behind-the-scenes access. To put yourself in front of out-of-the-ordinary subjects many of us might never get to sketch. What are some of the most exotic places location sketching has taken you? When you plan these missions, how do you select a worthwhile subject? What makes your list of "must draw" places? Any advice for Urban Sketchers on how to make these adventures happen?</span><br />Rather than retell stories that I’ve told on the blog, why don’t I just mention a few experiences, and people can follow links to a fuller description.<br /><br /><a data-mce-href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.ca/2012/06/crescent-wrench-factory.html" href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.ca/2012/06/crescent-wrench-factory.html" style="color: #999999; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"><img alt="Crescent_Wrench_Factory" class="alignnone  wp-image-3207" data-mce-src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/crescent_wrench_factory.jpg" data-mce-style="border: 1px solid black;" height="300" src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/crescent_wrench_factory.jpg" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px;" width="400" /></a><br />[Crescent wrench factory]<br /><br /><a data-mce-href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.ca/2013/03/urban-plein-air-painting.html" href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.ca/2013/03/urban-plein-air-painting.html" style="color: #999999; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"><img alt="Newburgh2013" class="alignnone  wp-image-3209" data-mce-src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/newburgh2013.jpg" data-mce-style="border: 1px solid black;" height="273" src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/newburgh2013.jpg" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px;" width="400" /></a><br />[Dangerous neighborhoods]<br /><a data-mce-href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.ca/2012/04/part-4-shanghai-diary-zhujiajiao.html" href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.ca/2012/04/part-4-shanghai-diary-zhujiajiao.html" style="color: #999999; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"><br /><img alt="Wang_Wei" class="alignnone  wp-image-3211" data-mce-src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/wang_wei.jpg?w=600" data-mce-style="border: 1px solid black;" height="301" src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/wang_wei.jpg?w=600" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px;" width="400" /></a><br />[Boat in Shanghai]<br /><br /><a data-mce-href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.ca/2008/11/manhandled-by-apes.html" href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.ca/2008/11/manhandled-by-apes.html" style="color: #999999; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"><img alt="ApeOnShoulder" class="alignnone  wp-image-3214" data-mce-src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/apeonshoulder.jpg?w=600" data-mce-style="border: 1px solid black;" height="400" src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/apeonshoulder.jpg?w=600" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px;" width="300" /></a><br />[Monkeys in Gibraltar]<br /><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #3366ff;" style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>MTH:</strong>&nbsp;There&#39;s plenty more!

I’m usually not interested in art-workshop destinations in Tuscany or touristy places that are overrun with artists. I prefer non-motifs, the little beauties that everyone passes by. The sketches that mean the most to me are closest to my own life. I love what Andrew Wyeth did by staying within a very narrow perimeter.<br /><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #3366ff;" style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>MTH:</strong>&nbsp;In the Urban Sketching community we have a kind of ‘aesthetic agreement’ that we are all sketching from first hand observation. (At least, what we choose to post on these pages). Mostly this is because we enjoy the idea of getting out and seeing the world. But it can lead to an assumption that drawing from life is always superior to drawing from reference. We started to touch on this topic on our sketching outing, but didn’t get too far in.&nbsp; I get the impression you don’t use much photographic reference, or try to avoid it when possible. Is that generally true? How do you feel about all that – the from life vs. from photography question?</span><br /><strong>J.G.:</strong>&nbsp;I love photography and I use photographic reference in my studio work. But keep in mind that my specialty is painting realistic images of things that can’t be photographed. Photos only get you part way there. For that work, I build maquettes and get people to pose and look at reference. But what I’m actually visualizing is something that is altogether beyond the reach of a camera, such as a dinosaur, an ancient Roman, or a mech robot.<br /><br />When I’m outdoors sketching from observation, my goals are very different. I’m trying to catch life on the run. I love the challenge of trying to record changing light and moving subjects.<br /><br /><a data-mce-href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.ca/2012/12/mass-in-c.html" href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.ca/2012/12/mass-in-c.html" style="color: #999999; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"><img alt="Mass_in_C" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3218" data-mce-src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/mass_in_c.jpg" data-mce-style="border: 1px solid black;" height="377" src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/mass_in_c.jpg" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px;" width="600" /></a><br />[Mass in C]<br /><br />The sense of urgency that it induces in me forces me to improvise and act on intuition. There would be no reason for me to take photos on location and work from them in the studio, because that exercise would have no purpose and would hold no interest for me.<br /><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #3366ff;" style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>MTH:</strong>&nbsp;So, your&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://www.youtube.com/user/gurneyjourney" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/gurneyjourney" style="color: #999999; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>&nbsp;is pretty awesome!</span><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #3366ff;" style="color: #3366ff;">Your mini-documentaries of your sketching outings are quite sophisticated - voice over, multiple cameras, establishing footage, even tracking shots. And you’re very generous with the amount of content.</span><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #3366ff;" style="color: #3366ff;">It must take a lot of mental energy, juggling between doing the artwork and operating multiple cameras. Can I just outright ask – what makes all of that worthwhile? You’re a rare example, an artist who chooses to do all that on location. Many of us would find it terribly distracting. Yet you are able to make excellent drawings, and be a documentary filmmaker at the same time. (Not that I am trying to get you to stop – please do keep making these films).</span><br /><strong>J.G.:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks. Why do I do it? I grew up in a family with no artists, I didn’t take art classes, and I was kind of a loner. So all through my youth, I never got to watch anyone else drawing or painting from life.<br /><br />Once I arrived at art school and started meeting other artists, I was completely captivated with how other people made a picture. And I was fascinated to learn what they were thinking about as they did so.<br /><br />I believe that drawing from observation is an intensely magical act, like a form of conjuring. What I’m trying to do with my videos is to try to bottle that magic, to catch the fish and tell the fish story at the same time.<br /><br /><img alt="Sketchbook_Pochade" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3219" data-mce-src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/sketchbook_pochade.jpg" data-mce-style="border: 1px solid black;" height="516" src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/sketchbook_pochade.jpg" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px;" width="600" /><br />[Sketchbook Pochade - Note Gopro Hero attached to egg timer. Some Yankee ingenuity at work.]<br /><br />Yes, it takes a good deal of focused attention to document a sketch while I’m making it. Sometimes I get so wrapped up in a piece that I forget to get good coverage.<br /><br />But a separate film crew can’t get the kind of coverage I’m after. They’re always on the outside looking in. In my videos, I not only want to show the viewer what I’m doing close up, but also to let them inside my head so they can see what I’m thinking.<br /><br />The other answer to what makes it worthwhile is that over the next few years I will be building a library of instructional videos for sale showing in detail how I use various media and how I solve various problems.<br /><br />In 2014 I will be releasing a video on watercolor painting on location, followed by other plein-air media.<br /><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #3366ff;" style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>MTH:</strong>&nbsp;Do you have some tips for a sketcher who wants to capture their own work on video? Some good introductory gear, or reliable techniques.</span><br /><strong>J.G.:</strong>&nbsp;Let’s start with techniques—Basic tips for shooting video of urban sketching:<br /><br />1. If you’re a beginner, use a tripod and NEVER pan or zoom.<br /><br />2. Get coverage. Shoot a lot of four second clips. It really helps to have a nice range of shots: an establishing shot, some closeups, some palette or pencil box shots, time lapse, reaction shots of people around you, plus a shot of the motif that you’re looking at. Get some audio background sounds and add voiceover later if you don’t want to narrate what you’re doing in real time. Editing is much easier if you’ve got good coverage, and it’s frustrating for the viewer if you don’t.<br /><br />3. Get a camera with manual controls, esp: focus lock, custom white balance, and manual exposure control, and learn to use them.<br /><br />4. You can use a basic editing program like iMovie. Edit your footage down as much as possible. Art in real time, like life in real time, is boring. It only gets exciting when it’s well edited.<br /><br />Gear:<br /><br />1. I use relatively inexpensive gear: a Canon Vixia HF R40 camcorder, a Canon T3i digital SLR, and a GoPro Hero2, with audio recorded on an H1 Zoom. I purchased all that gear for around $1,000.<br /><br />2. All the dolly rigs and motion control rigs are super cheap DIY workshop projects using Legos and broomsticks and stuff like that.<br /><br />3. I learned about video shooting and editing techniques from watching YouTube tutorials online. I shoot and edit all my own stuff.<br /><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #3366ff;" style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>MTH:</strong>&nbsp;Orling Dominguez of the Dominican Republic wanted me to ask about your technical process. You have an interesting mixed media approach, open to any tool or technique you can combine. What are you thinking as you bring all these different materials together? Have you developed a step-by-step process to your choices, or is it more ‘by feel’? What makes something suited for one approach over another?</span><br /><strong>J.G.:</strong>&nbsp;Good question, Orling. In my urban sketching kit, I bring art supplies that are totally cross-compatible: a fountain pen, water-soluble colored pencils and graphite pencils, water brushes (one with water and a couple others with water-soluble colored inks), a small Schmincke watercolor pan set, and a few tubes of gouache.&nbsp; I also have an oil painting kit and a casein kit.<br /><br /><a data-mce-href="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/whats-in-my-sketching_bag.jpg" href="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/whats-in-my-sketching_bag.jpg" style="color: #999999; text-decoration: none;"><img alt="Whats in my Sketching_Bag" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3226" data-mce-src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/whats-in-my-sketching_bag.jpg?w=600" data-mce-style="border: 1px solid black;" height="381" src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/whats-in-my-sketching_bag.jpg?w=600" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px;" width="600" /></a><br />[What&#39;s in my bag?]<br /><br />Basic thinking: there is no line between drawing and painting, and there are no “purist” rules. Anything goes as long as it’s conservationally sound. I use whatever media or methods convey the most information or mood in the time available. And of course, I only bring out what is reasonable to use in a given situation, such as a concert hall, a subway, or a restaurant.<br /><br /><a data-mce-href="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/plein-air-monterey.jpg" href="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/plein-air-monterey.jpg" style="color: #999999; text-decoration: none;"><img alt="Plein Air Monterey" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3227" data-mce-src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/plein-air-monterey.jpg?w=600" data-mce-style="border: 1px solid black;" height="378" src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/plein-air-monterey.jpg?w=600" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px;" width="600" /></a><br />[Plein Air Monterey]<br /><br /><img alt="Watercolor Rig" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3228" data-mce-src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/watercolor-rig.jpg?w=600" data-mce-style="border: 1px solid black;" height="755" src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/watercolor-rig.jpg?w=600" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px;" width="600" /><br />[James&#39;s watercolor gear. Not afraid to be an art nerd I see. I kid! We are all the same.]<br /><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #3366ff;" style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>MTH:</strong>&nbsp;I’m always interested if an artist has a philosophy about this: What makes something a sketch vs. a painting? Is that line so blurry you don’t even worry about it any longer?</span><br />I don’t place any boundaries between a sketch and a finish, or between a drawing and a painting. I like the word “study” because it implies a more carefully observant and patient mindset, but a work done as a study from life can have the power and detail of a finished work as well. A study is not necessarily a means to an end. But since we have to call our works something when we refer to them, we’re stuck with the limitations of the lexicon.<br /><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #3366ff;" style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>MTH:</strong>&nbsp;You have always been an example to other artists of a self-taught, highly motivated individual who is doing their own thing. Given that, I think this is a great closing question from Nina Johansson from Stockholm:&nbsp;</span><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #3366ff;" style="color: #3366ff;">"I assume that Gurney lives off of his art, and it would be interesting to get some hands-on advice for others who dream of doing that. We have been having this discussion at the school where I work, about how artists are usually not great at doing business, and how we would like to give our art students some classes in how to run a small business to be able to make a living - only the curriculum gets in the way. We&#39;ll see how it goes, but in the meantime I like to show them good examples. :)"</span><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #3366ff;" style="color: #3366ff;">If I can just add to that: I&#39;m assuming at this stage of your career, you can pretty much do what you want, pick your projects. What do you see as the most interesting ventures for artists in the next decade?</span><br /><a data-mce-href="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/highland-avenue.jpg" href="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/highland-avenue.jpg" style="color: #999999; text-decoration: none;"><img alt="Highland Avenue" class="alignnone  wp-image-3229" data-mce-src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/highland-avenue.jpg" data-mce-style="border: 1px solid black;" height="397" src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/highland-avenue.jpg" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px;" width="599" /></a><br />[Highland Avenue]<br /><br />Thanks, yes, it’s true, I’ve always lived off the brush and I’ve always painted what I want. Some years a lot of money rolls in; other years I make less than a janitor. But I’ve always been happy and followed my muse.<br /><br /><a data-mce-href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.ca/2011/05/mud-puddle.html" href="http://gurneyjourney.blogspot.ca/2011/05/mud-puddle.html" style="color: #999999; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank"><img alt="Mud Puddle" class="alignnone  wp-image-3230" data-mce-src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/mud-puddle.jpg" data-mce-style="border: 1px solid black;" height="414" src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/mud-puddle.jpg" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px;" width="601" /></a><br />[Mud Puddle]<br /><br />I believe every art student should get schooling in business: marketing, contracts, accounting, publicity, and especially in this age of creator-producer, it’s important to know about distribution, and sales. If art schools don’t offer this, you can pick it up on your own. I’m always trying to learn new things about how to make what I love to do pay for my living.<br /><br />That said, I try to keep business considerations from driving what I do or how I do it. I just want to have fun doing the very best quality work I can. I’m glad that the internet lets me share what I produce and what I learn with others. I have faith that enough people will support me to keep me doing it.<br /><br /><a data-mce-href="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/bleecker-and-11th.jpg" href="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/bleecker-and-11th.jpg" style="color: #999999; text-decoration: none;"><img alt="Bleecker and 11th" class="alignnone  wp-image-3231" data-mce-src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/bleecker-and-11th.jpg" data-mce-style="border: 1px solid black;" height="385" src="http://citizensketcher.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/bleecker-and-11th.jpg" style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 0px;" width="597" /></a><br />[Bleecker and 11th]<br /><br />Sketching from life is making big strides forward, both with the Urban Sketchers and the plein-air-painting movements. Some people make a living doing these things, but that’s not why they’re important. People who sketch in their spare time from other jobs, and professionals who do it for relaxation or learning are just as important to the movement.<br /><br />Working directly from nature has always brought fresh blood into Art, and we’re all lucky to be living in the midst of this revival.<br /><br /><span data-mce-style="color: #3366ff;" style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>MTH:</strong>&nbsp;Well, thanks for all your generous time - you&#39;ve given us great answers, it&#39;s been really excellent having you! Hope to see you sketching on the street. If you&#39;re ever on the road, feel free to look up the local Urban Sketchers group wherever you are."</span><br /><div style="clear: both;"></div></div></div><div class="post-body entry-content" style="line-height: 1.6em; margin: 0px 0px 0.75em;">Thank you, Marc!
