         <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Singer_Sargent">John Singer Sargent&#39;s </a>(1856-1925) biographer Evan Charteris tells the story of one of the oddest episodes of the artist&#39;s career, which occurred while he was staying in England shortly before Christmas, 1891.  </i><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HsvdHW9l0Ng/U92VowwoOpI/AAAAAAAAXl0/BK4vbxx84BE/s1600/Sargent+Self+Portrait.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HsvdHW9l0Ng/U92VowwoOpI/AAAAAAAAXl0/BK4vbxx84BE/s1600/Sargent+Self+Portrait.jpg" height="320" width="220" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Towards the end of the day he was riding homeward. He found himself in a field of winter wheat, a part of which he had to cross in order to reach a bridle path.  </span><br /><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: inherit;">He was no agriculturist; he probably would have found it difficult to distinguish between a field of potatoes and a field of turnips. In all ignorance and innocence, therefore, he continued his way. His movements had been observed; through the twilight the owner of the winter wheat advanced upon him and without preliminaries launched out into a torrent of low abuse. Sargent was completely surprised.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span><br /><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">He dismounted, and as the man drew near, [Sargent] began to apologize for his mistake, offering to make good any damage he had done. Far from being pacified by his courtesy, the farmer became more incensed. He worked himself into a frenzy of rage and loaded Sargent with every variety of threat and malediction.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">He was well known in the neighbourhood as a surly and foul-mouthed fellow, and Sargent, deeply agitated, mastered his temper and moved away, mounted his horse and rode home. That evening he described what had happened; Mrs. Abbey states that he was obviously in the grip of an agitating distress. At intervals he would return to the subject and discuss what he ought to do.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">For two days he was uneasy and silent and could do no work. Late on the second day he went out. Towards evening of that day Mrs. Abbey was returning from a walk. Her road led past the gate of the house where the farmer lived. As she approached, a figure walked rapidly down the path; drawing nearer she saw in the dusk that it was Sargent. When he joined her he exclaimed: "I&#39;ve done it — I&#39;ve done it."&nbsp;</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">He was calmer than he had been at any time since the adventure. He went on to tell her that after looking at the thing from every side and turning it over and over in his mind he had settled what he ought to do; he had gone to the farmer&#39;s door, knocked, and when the farmer appeared, had said:  <br /><br />"Come outside and defend yourself, I am going to thrash you." </span><br /><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">The farmer called on his household to witness the assault, and then, answering the challenge, engaged in a struggle in the course of which Sargent appears to have carried out his threat. Such was the amazing story told as he and Mrs. Abbey walked home.  <br /><br />The farmer at once sought the help of the law. It was doubtful at first whether he would proceed by summons before a magistrate or by a civil action for damages. Sargent put the matter in the hands of Sir George Lewis. On January 21 Sir George wrote that the farmer had issued a writ for damages.  <br /><br />He advised payment into court. £50 was considered adequate. The farmer accepted the sum, and proceedings went no further; and there, so far as Sargent was concerned, this curious episode ended.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">Later an unexpected turn was given to it by an invitation from the farmer to Sargent asking him to dine. Sargent declined, but as a reconciliation was in the air [Sargent&#39;s friends] de Glehn and Finn took his place, and found the farmer if not ready to forgive, at any rate determined effectually to achieve forgetfulness by conviviality. Legend has it that Sargent spent the interval between the insult and the assault in taking lessons in boxing. This scarcely needs denial; he spent the interval, it is true, in deep perplexity. <br /><br />His sense of justice, always lively, but balanced, had been outraged, but his indignation had cooled and had been replaced by a reasoned view of what under the circumstances it was right to do. He acted in a manner which was unspeakably distasteful to him, driven forward by the conviction that no other course was honourably open to him. It was in no spirit of revenge that he acted, it was probably with no sense of personal grievance, but on a conclusion of judgment arrived at on a point of honour.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: inherit;">------</span></div><div><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1163176745/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1163176745&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gurnjour-20&amp;linkId=VZ5UVKZW4X3WRFOK">John Sargent</a><img alt="" border="0" src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=gurnjour-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1163176745" height="1" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /> by the Hon.
