As a correspondent to the <a href="http://www.urbansketchers.org/">Urban Sketchers</a> website and his own <a href="https://citizensketcher.com/">Citizen Sketcher site</a>, he has contributed to the field of observational sketching. He sent me a copy of his most recent book, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1979762023/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1979762023&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gurnjour-20&amp;linkId=2c7bc0f8b5ccb718c0be8d34727ec2fc" target="_blank">Direct Watercolor</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=gurnjour-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1979762023" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /></i>, which he published with <a href="https://www.createspace.com/">Amazon&#39;s CreateSpace</a>&nbsp;independent publishing platform.<br /><div><span style="text-align: center;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="text-align: center;">Since Marc has often written on his blog about business opportunities facing artists, I asked him if I could interview him about his new book, focusing less on the contents of the book and more on his decision to publish it the way he did. If you&#39;re reading this, and you have a book idea you&#39;d like to see in print, you&#39;re facing a lot of choices right now for how to bring your book to market. Here&#39;s what Marc has to say about the CreateSpace option.</span><br /><div><div style="font-weight: bold;"><b><br /></b></div><b>Gurney: You published your two previous books (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1440334714/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1440334714&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gurnjour-20&amp;linkId=ff4453dd911e0f0fee3ef18f0e6081fc" target="_blank">The Urban Sketcher: Techniques for Seeing and Drawing on Location</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=gurnjour-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1440334714" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />(North Light)&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1440344094/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1440344094&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gurnjour-20&amp;linkId=8e54718c02b169b49aaaff72831f523a" target="_blank">Designing Creatures and Characters</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=gurnjour-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1440344094" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />(North Light) with traditional publishers. Why did you decide to publish&nbsp;</b><i><b><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1979762023/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1979762023&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gurnjour-20&amp;linkId=2c7bc0f8b5ccb718c0be8d34727ec2fc" target="_blank">Direct Watercolor</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=gurnjour-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1979762023" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /></b></i><b>&nbsp;with Amazon&#39;s CreateSpace?</b><br />Holmes: I still have a good relationship with my publisher - they&#39;re selling plenty of Urban Sketching books! It’s not like I would refuse a good offer from them or any other traditional imprint.<br /><br />But, on the other hand, I have the skills and a pretty good social media platform - so my thinking is; if it’s within your abilities to make content at a professional level, and you think you can forego the publisher&#39;s marketing and distribution, then why not keep the lion’s share of the royalties? <br /><br />Yes, I have to pay Amazon a fee to distribute - but it’s not even close to what I have to give over to a traditional publisher in exchange for things that, arguably, I&#39;m good at already. (I&#39;ll let you know someday if everything I just said was hopelessly romantic. It&#39;s early days yet). <br /><br />But mostly - to be completely honest with you - Direct Watercolor is a ‘best of’ book. The result of five years of teaching at Urban Sketchers events. My publisher passed on that concept. They don’t see it as a match with their audience, or their copyright model (they don&#39;t republish old work, they seek to own new work) - but for me, it’s right on target for my fans. <br /><br /><b>Why did you decide not to go with the Kickstarter model of crowd funding and self publishing?</b><br />I can see how some people might be attracted to Kickstarter. It *sounds* great to be paid up front :)<br /><br />But for me, I’d feel too much pressure. I don&#39;t like thinking that I’ve started a ticking clock and I need to deliver on a specific promise. I guess, in that way I’m a real artist :)<br /><br /><b>How does Amazon CreateSpace work with their authors?</b><br />It’s an automated process with zero human interaction. Their site has a deep FAQ with plenty of videos on the mechanics, but it’s up to you to do your research.<br /><br /><b>Do they provide a graphics template, editorial guidelines, or feedback?&nbsp;</b><br />There are templates for all the book sizes they offer, but I do believe they’re in MS Word? So I didn’t use them. <br /><br /><b>Do they vet ideas initially or approve them before printing?&nbsp;</b><br />It’s my understanding Amazon doesn&#39;t vet anything - beyond an automated flight-check for technical flaws, (e.g.: the software can tell if your image goes off the page) and probably, a staffer does a sanity check for offensive or illegal content. <br /><br /><b>What, if any, changes did they request?</b><br />They&#39;ll never request changes or offer advice, only say ‘yes this will print as-is’ (or not).<br /><br /><b>What does CreateSpace charge for their publishing services?&nbsp;</b><br />It’s completely free up front. There used to be a small setup charge, but now it’s free-to-play. <br /><br /><b>Do they try to up-sell you on creative services?</b><br />They do have professional services, but the sales pitch is very minor - you just skip any assistance you don’t need on the site.<br /><br /><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qJh5kD7V7MQ/WpabQI_eSWI/AAAAAAACKU4/7orfWoQBvXgCFNGy7bT9Ejj58S9wttwQwCLcBGAs/s1600/direct-watercolor_marc-taro-holmes16.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="898" data-original-width="902" height="397" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qJh5kD7V7MQ/WpabQI_eSWI/AAAAAAACKU4/7orfWoQBvXgCFNGy7bT9Ejj58S9wttwQwCLcBGAs/s400/direct-watercolor_marc-taro-holmes16.jpg" width="400" /></a><br /><b>Who designed the book, what software did you use, and what did you deliver (such as JPEGs, PDF file, InDesign file or proprietary CreateSpace file)?</b><br />I designed it! Hurrah!:) <br /><br />I used InDesign for the page layouts, Illustrator for the cover and Photoshop for scanning. I did take graphic design in art school so I have a leg up, but it’s been 15 years, so I took an InDesign course on <a href="http://lynda.com/">Lynda.com</a> to brush up. <br /><br />The cover does require very specific templates. There is a feature on the CreateSpace site to customize the spine-width based on the number of pages in your project - which is very helpful. Doing that yourself requires math. They also put the barcode on for you - as long as you leave a correctly measured white box for them to print into. They also automatically assign you an ISBN number.<br /><br />I will also mention, the eBook conversion process is much easier these days. I used Amazon&#39;s (free tool) Kindle Create to convert a PDF to a KPF, which is the latest proprietary Kindle format. Then you send that through Amazon&#39;s other site - Kindle Direct Publishing - and it appears in the Kindle store in 24 hours. <br /><br />There have been announcements they will be rolling CreateSpace back into Amazon central soon, removing the need for two sites and two accounts.<br /><br /><b>Why didn&#39;t you include any photos of you or your working setup, or photos of your motif?</b><br />I committed to the very short 100-page book for practical reasons. It’s a sweet spot for retail price vs. printing cost vs. download size for the eBook vs. time to design. Once I made the choice that it would be a short book, I knew I would include nothing but art. <br /><br />The how-I-made-this aspect is so well documented on my website, which is free and well known in the community, I felt I didn’t need the book to cover the same ground. <br /><br />As well, I frequently update my supplies page on the site (<a href="https://citizensketcher.com/class-notes/">https://citizensketcher.com/class-notes/</a>). This always has my current favorite brushes, or what pigments I have on the palette this week. I don’t want this information going stale in a printed book.<br /><br /><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JTJ91AYoY8c/WpabL70uKQI/AAAAAAACKU0/cU1nWU7B3SEsYNHUkwfKzX4xm691-jBuQCLcBGAs/s1600/direct-watercolor_marc-taro-holmes47.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="350" data-original-width="700" height="200" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JTJ91AYoY8c/WpabL70uKQI/AAAAAAACKU0/cU1nWU7B3SEsYNHUkwfKzX4xm691-jBuQCLcBGAs/s400/direct-watercolor_marc-taro-holmes47.jpg" width="400" /></a><br /><b>How did you shoot your artwork?&nbsp;</b><br />I scan all the artwork on a desktop Epson scanner and stitch it together in Photoshop. This is essentially software-automated now.<br /><br /><b>For your step-by-steps, did you shoot them in a studio with copy lights or in the field?</b><br />For the step-by-steps, they are actually shot on an iPhone5 using a Manfrotto magic arm, so I can get the ‘over the shoulder’ shot. Since I was designing my own pages, I knew the demo images were going to be super-small on the page, so I could get away with it.<br /><br />The demos are studio work, which is ironic in a plein-air book, but of course, using the same technique and gear as I would on location, and sometimes painted from my own painting, instead of from a photo. <br /><br />A lot of the field work was done in places like Copacabana beach at midnight, or in the Irish countryside in the pouring rain. Or painted in a stolen half hour before breakfast at a workshop. I feel like I wouldn&#39;t have gotten the paintings if I&#39;d also been filming. It&#39;s often a direct relationship. How much gear you are carrying subtracts from how much you&#39;re painting.<br /><br />I know you&#39;re a master at guerrilla filmmaking! So I suppose if I pushed further into that I could figure it out? But there you have it.<br /><br /><b>What role did your wife play in creating the book? Did anyone else help on your end?</b><br />Laurel absolutely edits everything I write and is a big part of choosing what goes in and what gets cut.<br /><br />She also shoots all the reference that I do use. She’s a real photographer who would never touch an iPhone. Most of the people who say &#39;never paint from photos&#39; don&#39;t have a modern camera, dual calibrated monitors, and a giant museum quality printer. <br /><br />She also helps clear the decks around here so I have time to write and paint! Which is a crucial role isn’t it? Not to be underestimated. <br /><br />Oh, and she handles all the travel planning and the logistics of getting to painting locations. So really, she does a lot to make the books happen.<br /><br /><b>Why did you choose the square format and the 99-page length?</b><br />I mentioned the book&#39;s page count above. As for the format - the years this book covers, I was doing a lot of diptychs. Two 1/4 sheets of watercolor, paired horizontally like an open sketchbook. It was how I fit landscape panoramas in a shoulder bag while hiking around a foreign city. The long 2:1 book format suited these images. It’s obvious in the eBook, which is ‘letterboxed’ in two-page spreads.<br /><br /><b>Are you happy with the print quality and the binding? Did you get a proof stage with the ability to input comments?</b><br />You get as many proofs as you like - though you have to pay to ship to yourself&nbsp;(about $30/copy rush, to Montreal. As it&#39;s likely less for anyone else. ). I’m happy with the quality of the paper, while I acknowledge it could be better. I think it’s a trade-off. Perhaps one day I’ll be able to re-issue a collectors edition with a superior binding. Or a hardcover! Wouldn’t that be nice?<br /><br /><b>How was the price established at US $24.95 (list) and US $22.45 (Amazon discount)</b><br />The list price is entirely up to the author. <br /><br />It&#39;s ironically not as good a deal for Canadians, as Amazon doesn&#39;t price match - they just convert the USD price - so it&#39;s $33 here at home! <br /><br />Also - Indy publishers will be glad to know - Amazon sometimes discounts the price, but does not discount your royalties. The author is not penalized for Amazon&#39;s choice to put it on sale. <br /><br />At the end of the day, I feel this kind of book is primarily for fans and supporters of my work. People will support me because they like my content - or they won&#39;t. It&#39;s the bloggers&#39; social contract, isn&#39;t it? If people love my free website, this is the one thing they can do to tangibly support me.  <br /><br />I&#39;m not pretending The Urban Sketcher isn&#39;t better value-for-money. It&#39;s currently on sale for $18.76. Just pound for pound there is a lot of information in my first book. But there is a lot of hard-won experience in Direct Watercolor. And it&#39;s a beautiful book :) <br /><br />So that&#39;s all the thinking behind that!<br /><br /><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-95oNJUNuShI/WpaakdEtsfI/AAAAAAACKUk/0WX6Iqyu1PwahUx2y38n_Ef0BiZlqqr5wCLcBGAs/s1600/Direct%2BWatercolor%2Bback.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="500" data-original-width="493" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-95oNJUNuShI/WpaakdEtsfI/AAAAAAACKUk/0WX6Iqyu1PwahUx2y38n_Ef0BiZlqqr5wCLcBGAs/s320/Direct%2BWatercolor%2Bback.jpg" width="314" /></a><br /><br /><b>Is the digital edition available in any other formats or for any other devices besides the Kindle app and the Kindle Fire?&nbsp;</b><br />Right now, no. As far as I know, there&#39;s a kindle app for anything that has a screen. If you&#39;re reading this now, you can read the ebook on the same device.   <br /><br />I could put it up on the iBooks store, or Kobo, but honestly, all my research is saying you&#39;re better off writing a new book than chasing down alternate sales streams. I could be wrong here, I&#39;m just a guy with a dream. When I&#39;m more organized I&#39;ll &#39;go wide&#39; as the self-publishers call it.<br /><br /><b>Are you contractually precluded from releasing it in other formats?</b><br />Authors can choose to be exclusive with Amazon, but I did not. <br /><br />If you do, you can be in their &#39;all you can read&#39; library called Kindle Unlimited. But I feel that&#39;s more for fiction than for art books? (Romance, Fantasy, Thrillers). So I didn&#39;t go that route and I&#39;m able to sell it anywhere I choose, as long as it&#39;s at price parity with Amazon. <br /><br /><b>Is <i>Direct Watercolor</i> sold in brick-and-mortar stores, or any online stores besides Amazon?</b><br />Again, you can choose to allow bookstores to order and re-sell your print-on-demand book, but I did not.<br /><br />Amazon has set this up to be as rough as possible on the bookstores. The author has to subsidize the reseller. (Amazon calls this &#39;Expanded Distribution&#39;). If I were to sign up for it, I&#39;d be giving almost 70% of my royalties to the bookstore. It just didn&#39;t make sense for this project. <br /><br />I apologize to all the independent bookstores out there. And if I was writing a detective novel, I probably would do it, because browsing would be a bigger factor than fan-support. I wish there was a better solution for this. If I lived in the US I would handle shipping books to stores myself. But as a Canadian, I can&#39;t manage the shipping costs. (Book rate shipping does not apply cross-border). <br /><br /><b>There&#39;s a note on the back page that the book was printed in South Carolina just four days ago. Does Amazon print on demand and do the shipping for you?&nbsp;</b><br />Yes, it&#39;s quite amazing. The book does not exist until it&#39;s ordered. When a customer clicks, it&#39;s printed, bound and shipped by their system. It&#39;s pretty cool. I hear they are developing &#39;book vending machines&#39; that do this while you watch. They&#39;re used in libraries to create copies of books that don&#39;t circulate that often - so they aren&#39;t taking up shelf space for eternity.<br /><br /><b>Do they ship internationally?</b><br />Amazon also tries not to ship internationally. They print in various countries and try to keep the shipping local. It&#39;s not perfect - Australia has to pay for shipping from the US - but I&#39;m sure the plan is to have a robot printer in every city someday.<br /><br /><b>Does Amazon have foreign translation rights?&nbsp;</b><br />I own the entire copyright package. So they would have to contact me and make a deal. <br /><br /><b>So, for example, if you were approached by a Japanese publisher who wanted to publish your book in the Japanese language, what would you do?</b><br />That&#39;s one situation where the traditional publisher is more likely to be successful. The Urban Sketcher is in all sorts of languages from Czech to Chinese. But - as a first-time author at the time of that deal, I didn&#39;t have the clout to negotiate those rights, so I don&#39;t make more than beer money on translations.<br /><br /><b>How is the income divided? Does Amazon take a fixed fee per book, or a percentage of the sale price? Do they take any fees off the top in advance of dividing the income?</b><br />This is hard to explain. The fees differ based on many variables including where the customer lives - but anyone can go to the CreateSpace website and play with their &#39;royalties calculator&#39; to see how their own numbers might work. It simplifies things to &#39;if I charge X, I make Y&#39;. <br /><br />Try it out here: <a href="https://www.createspace.com/Products/Book/">https://www.createspace.com/Products/Book/</a><br /><br /><b>Can you order copies for your own online or event sales? If so, what discount do you get?</b><br />Authors pay only the fixed costs plus shipping, handling, and tax. So yes, it&#39;s feasible to buy boxes of your own book and go to trade shows and book fairs.<br /><br /><b>How have you promoted the book?&nbsp;</b><br />I have my passion project - my website CitizenSketcher.com. In a way, I am constantly promoting, and at the same time, I never promote. <br /><br />I just paint, and talk about how I paint, and it all works out. <br /><br /><b>What has Amazon done to promote it?</b><br />Amazon has their magical &#39;other customers bought this&#39; recommendations under every listing. That&#39;s a very effective promo every author gets automatically, based on search relevance and your Amazon sales rank. I also like their &#39;look inside&#39; feature, and the downloadable e-sample. It&#39;s almost like browsing in a store, but people can do it anywhere they&#39;re online.<br /><br /><b>How do the Kindle sales compare in proportional terms to the print sales?</b><br />It is early days, but right now it&#39;s about 3:1 paper vs. eBook. Which makes sense to me. It&#39;s a nice looking book right :) So if the paper version is affordable to people, they choose that. It does look great on an iPad pro :) And is surprisingly nice on your phone even! But not everyone has that option.<br /><br /><b>Does Amazon give you analytics about quantities sold, territories, demographics, returns?&nbsp;</b><br />They do give you excellent stats. All the above. Particularly when you consider, you only hear numbers from your traditionally published books two times a year! You can refresh your sales page on Amazon by the hour if you like. <br /><br /><b>Is there an audit provision?</b><br />The audit provision is a very good question. See, that show&#39;s your experience. I didn&#39;t think to check on that.<br /><br /><b>What did you give up and what did you gain by going with CreateSpace?</b><br />Well, I would not go with any other kind of self-publishing. The old-fashioned self-publishing model is to print books at personal expense, store them in your garage, and sell them out of your car at book fairs. It&#39;s a very hard way to make a living, and simply impossible for a Canadian. (Country too big, people too thin on the ground).<br /><br /><div>So - versus traditional publishing? I gained: a significantly advantageous royalty deal, control over the theme and content, a book out in the world much faster than trad pub can produce, and I&#39;d say a better-looking art book (no knock on my previous designers, but it&#39;s a labor of love here, and they have deadlines and workloads). <br /><br />What did I lose? I&#39;m not sure I lost anything. I&#39;ll let you know. We can do the article &#39;Why did I ever try self-publishing!?&#39; if we need to next year.<br /><br />I will say, I turned down an offer for a third traditional publishing deal - they would have paid me to not do this book at all, and instead do a book on watercolor sketching for beginners - but I wanted to make THIS book, not a different book, which would have taken me another year to complete, and them six to nine months to get to market. This way fans get a book today, and probably a book next year too!<br /><br /><b>Would you publish your next book this way?&nbsp;</b><br />It&#39;s my hope that I&#39;ll continue to do both. I know I&#39;ll self-publish again because I&#39;ve already started a project :) (Too soon to say what!) <br /><br /><b>Would you ever go back to doing a book with a traditional publisher?</b><br />I&#39;d love to sign another traditional deal - if the offer is sound. The question is, can someone like me get them to be competitive? Do they even care about mid-listers like myself? Perhaps they plan to thrive with a superstar model where they exist solely to publish the top 1% of authors. The average publisher advance is shrinking for new authors, but the highest advances are bigger than ever. So it&#39;s getting less and less equitable.<br /><br />It&#39;s possible, doing well with self-publishing might be the way to gain a better negotiating position. So, I think it will be back and forth, a bit of both :)<br />-----<br />Check out Marc&#39;s book&nbsp;<i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1979762023/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1979762023&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gurnjour-20&amp;linkId=2c7bc0f8b5ccb718c0be8d34727ec2fc" target="_blank">Direct Watercolor</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=gurnjour-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1979762023" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />&nbsp;on Amazon.</i></div></div></div>
